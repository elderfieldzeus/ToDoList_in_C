## A personal To-Do List program written in C programming Language (Linked List Implementation)
#### How to link program.c to todo_list.c:

To link two c programs using gcc, enter this line in the terminal:

```
gcc <name_of_program> <name_of_program>
```

In our case it is:


```
gcc ./program.c ./header/todo_list.c
```

To run the file, run the line/s below:

Windows:
```
.\a.exe
```

Linux:
```
./a.out
```

Enjoy haha
