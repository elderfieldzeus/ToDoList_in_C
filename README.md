## A personal To-Do List program written in C programming Language (Linked List Implementation)
#### To start the program first link program.c to ./header/todo_list.c

To link to c programs using gcc, use this line in the terminal:

```
gcc <name_of_program> <name_of_program>
```

In our case it is:


```
gcc program.c ./header/todo_list.c
```

To run the file, run the line below:

```
./a.out
```

Enjoy haha
